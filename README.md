# Objective

Our project aims to spread awareness among people about the increasing pollution levels in India, especially during the months of October and November.
These sudden peaks in pollution levels are due to heavy burning of firecrackers to celebrate Diwali. By taking the help of figures and graphs, we make it easier for everyone to observe for themselves how harmful burning firecrackers can be and needs to be immediately brought to a hault.
